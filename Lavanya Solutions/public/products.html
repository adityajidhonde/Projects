            <div class="q1"><h3>Why does everyone love hair extensions?</h3><p>First, hair extensions are becoming more and more popular because they instantly make anyone's hair more beautiful and glamorous by giving you added length and volume. Most red-carpet and supermodel looks created using hair extensions, but you don't have to be a supermodel to get your best hair yet. You’re a modern babe, and you can have it all, including the hair of your dreams with extensions.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Do Hair extensions damage your natural hair?</h3><p>No! This is a common myth that has been around for years. While it may have some amount of truth when it comes to older types of hair extensions that are applied using heat tools and chemicals, or DIY extensions, this is definitely not true when it comes to most newer extensions, including the ones we use at DashBar.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Can I get extensions if my hair is damaged?</h3><p>Yes! People who have damaged or thinning hair can especially benefit from professional hair extensions. The extensions may actually help protect your damaged hair and can give you a boost of beauty confidence.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>What’s a Blowout?</h3><p>You’ve never had a blowout? We’ll fill you in. If you’re like us, you’re probably living that dry shampoo life because who has time to wash their hair every day? You have a to-do list that’s a mile long, and styling your hair isn’t the number one item on it. A blowout is when you allow us to shampoo, condition, and style your hair. It’s relaxing, you’ll look amazing, and your hair will still look good days later.</p></div>

            <!-- <div class="q2"><h3>How to Plan Your Perfect Miami Staycation?</h3><p>With everything Miami has to offer, you don’t have time to waste an entire day going from salon to salon for your well-deserved pampering. We put together the perfect staycation checklist, and we’ll have you feeling rejuvenated, relaxed, and looking gorgeous in under an hour.</p></div> -->
            <!-- <div class="q2"><h3>How can I try a darker hair color in winter without looking pasty?</h3><p>Darker doesn't have to mean a boring, flat shade that emphasizes pale skin. To winterize your current mane without feeling like Wednesday Addams, use an at-home semipermanent hair color in a warm golden shade that's similar to your natural hue. This will make the streaked sections look darker and the other strands look richer.</p></div> -->
            <!-- <div class="q2"><h3>How can I return to my natural hair color?</h3><p>It's not as easy as slapping on some brown dye, but with these pointers, you can get your natural color back. When you bleach your tresses, you strip away the rainbow of tones (bits of red, yellow, and blue) that make up a rich brown hair hue.</p></div> -->
            <!-- <div class="q2"><h3>How can I avoid staining my forehead when I'm dyeing my hair at home?</h3><p>There's a supereasy fix for skin that's stained around your hairline. Simply apply a layer of lip balm or a hair mask on your forehead to block dye pigments from seeping on. (Or try Repelle Skin Shield Wand, $4.99, made for just this purpose.)</p></div> -->
        <!-- </div> -->
        <!-- <div class="w3">
            <div class="q3"><h3>How do I blow dry the back of my hair</h3><p>Clip up the top of your strands before blow-drying. Working from the bottom up, unfasten 2-inch-wide layers of hair at a time and dry each portion completely.

            <div class="q3"><h3>What are some correct blow-drying techniques?</h3><p>Since your mane man is standing above you when styling your locks, it's very easy for him to keep the dryer constantly moving from the roots to the ends of your hair, which is the trick to preventing the dryer from scorching it. This quick motion is nearly impossible to achieve on your own (especially in the back of your head), so if you hold the dryer too close to your strands, it can be damaging. </p></div>
            <div class="q3"><h3>I want to give my tresses a fuller look. Any tips?</h3><p>After you've finished blow-drying, lift up a large section of hair, then slowly let it go bit by bit while misting with a light-hold hair spray. This creates lots of air pockets, which give your hair tons of body.</p></div>
            <div class="q3"><h3>How do I tame a cowlick?</h3><p>It's easy to tame that unruly tuft of hair. One option is to aim a blow-dryer at the root area while using a brush to coax your loco lock into an attractive position (keep holding it down until it cools).</p></div>

            <div class="q1"><h3>Why do I need facials?</h3><p>A regular facial routine is more about skin health and maintenance than it is about luxury or pampering, although many do find it to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience. Facial services help increase circulation and stimulate the skin. They can also help slow down premature aging and drastically improve conditions such as acne, redness and Rosacea. </p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Why do I need a professional skin therapist?</h3><p>For the same reason doctor and dentist check-ups are necessary: for better health! Skin is a living part of your body (your largest organ, in fact), that defends against environmental assaults and extreme temperatures. It helps eliminate toxins from the body, and it is continually renewing and protecting.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>How soon will I start seeing results from my facial?</h3><p>Some people see results immediately, and your skin should feel different
                right away. The skin feels, clean, smooth, hydrated, and reflects a new
                level of health that’s visibly noticeable.
                If the skin has more advanced long-term needs, such as treatment of skin
                aging, acne or hyper-pigmentation caused by hormonal fluctuations or sun
                damage, results may not be immediately visible; however, skin health will
                continue to improve as you follow the advice of your professional skin
                therapist, and continue your home-care regimen.
                </p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>What are the long-term benefits of getting regular facials?</h3><p>Plain and simple: healthy skin! And healthy skin is better-looking skin. The
                Dermalogica products A Shear Thing Salon uses are designed to help keep 
                skin at an optimal level of fitness – not just cover up with cosmetic results.
                In addition, when skin is at an optimal level of fitness, your professional
                skin therapist can more effectively address issues that may arise from
                time to time, as your skin’s needs are constantly changing.</p></div>

    <div id="p3" class="tabcontent">
        <div class="w1">
            <div class="q1"><h3>Why is waxing better than shaving?</h3><p>When you wax, the entire hair shaft is removed, root and all, rather than cutting it off at the surface of the skin like you do when you shave. This leaves your skin super smooth with no stubble. Waxing also lasts much longer than shaving, and the hair grows back thinner and finer with repeated treatments.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Does waxing hurt?</h3><p>In General, Yes! Although all of us have a different pain tolerance, so the level of discomfort will vary according to your threshold for pain. Most clients will experience a decrease in pain when they consistently wax over a period of time without shaving in between.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Is there anything I can do to help with the pain?</h3><p>Taking a mild pain killer 30-45 minutes prior to waxing will help a little with the pain. There are also topical numbing creams available that you can apply 30 minutes before your appointment. Avoid caffeine before waxing. If you are female, avoiding waxing the week before and of you period will reduce sensitivity.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>How long will waxing last?</h3><p>The answer to this question varies from person to person. We all have different rates of hair growth, and some body areas grow back more quickly than others. Your hair has various cycles of growth as well, so you want to make sure all of your hair is grown out prior to waxing, or else the hair that was not long enough to be removed will grow in a matter of days. </p></div>

    <div id="p4" class="tabcontent">
        <div class="w1">
            <div class="q1"><h3> How do I pick the perfect red lipstick?</h3><p>Women are always on the prowl for this. Choose cooler "true" red tones with a bit of blue if you have pink in your skin or are super fair-skinned. A warmer orange-red tone works best for olive-skinned women. </p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>How do I contour my face?</h3><p>Contouring seems like a daunting task if you've never done it. The reality is it's easier than you may think. The simplest way to understand contouring is to imagine a light over your head. The areas of the face that the light will illuminate are the highlights and the areas cast in shadows are the contours.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Which foundation works best?</h3><p>Foundation creates the illusion of a flawless complexion. First, you need to determine what type of coverage you want to achieve: sheer, medium, or full. Next, decide on the finish: matte, natural, or dewy. Estée Lauder has a huge variety, so they're usually my favorite.</p></div>
            <div class="q1"><h3>Can I wear foundation every day? How do I stop it from slipping off?</h3><p>You can always wear foundation just make sure to wear PRIMER! You can customize the primer for your skin concern as there are so many different kinds. This is the easiest way to wear foundation so it stays put.</p></div>
